<a name="top"></a>
Welcome to my portfolio interactive front end development application! My name is Daniel and through this project I present to you
roughly six weeks app development in the making.

# Technologies

1.HTML
2.CSS
3.Bootstrap v4.3.2
4.Javascript
5.Fontawsome
6.Jquery library
7.Emailjs

# Features
This project has a very simple design with a navigation menu along the top
and subcategory menu, that reveals professionally once clicked by the user.I
am very proud of the fact that the html and css markup came together and was 
designedto be simmple on the surface, but have depth when the user wants to 
engage and have more options for their match, thus improving user experience.
## Features Left To Implement

The features which I would like to implement would be to add a short tutorial
at the beginning of the game. This would introduce the games speacial features
and allow smoother gameplay. Also a modal to display best score to the user 
in a modal after restart of the match. As well as coloring the random category button, 
vocabulary button, and god mode differently to indentify them as special 
categories to the end user. Place the app in the google playstore store with my logo

# UX

My goal with ux design was to make sure that my application was user friendly 
and easy to navigate. I strived to make a user interface that could be up and 
running with as little as 1-2 clicks. I belive that I have achieved this 
through default mode which starts with a five second clock countdown to input 
the correct word.

Through this project I strived to demonstrate the basics of user friendly 
interface by adding interaction where people expect it,ie. a modal popup 
that prompts the user to follow the steps prior to clickng start match for 
a more meaningful experience. As well as using colors that were appealing to the 
eyes, that kept the application sleek but at the same time, provided 
a unique gameplay style from other games in this category. This in my opinion 
is what seperates my game from the competators; and makes it stand out as a 
clear winner in the marketplace.

# Testing
Some of the trials i encountered while testing and updating, were ranging from
the very basic to difficult. I seemed have trouble in the beingging articulating
my ideas into actual code that I wanted to implement into the project. Through
use of javascript logic and pseudocoding I was able to define a path for the 
game application and, as in what events would happen and when it would happen.
This formed the basics of the algorithmn for the app. These events include:
algorithmn
1.click start match else game starts
2. category selection onclick appears and rest appear inactive
3. countdown timer 3 seconds on start of game
4. add a stopwatch to start the match
5. from data set selected he should see a random word fromthat category selected.
6. game starts
7. from word selected show the word to user and start timer at the same time
8. when timer ends check text against correct answer stored
9. if win, clear users text bring anothe rrandom word and display it to the user
10. Save the correct user inputs in an array and save the level in a variable
11. if lose, check the length of array that contains the right words-- if empty
display-- you didnt get the word correct try again
12. switch and case through each array category selection (iterate) EXCLUDING 
13. VOCABULARY fetch the meaning from my own dictionary of terms.
14. in case, of vocabulary get definition from api call
15. display at the bottom (table style) word and definition in a row
16. on.document load set value to 0 after that the scores should add up.If 
refreshing everything loads to a frsh page.
17.make a function for else contained in the function initiate -game
then call the function in the else statement

# Deployment

This cite is hosted from Github directly from the master branch.
You may access the file through,

During my class and while working in a small group we were able to bring
testers in to test the game provide valuable feedback, in order upgrade the 
games capabilities in order to match real world demands of the end user. I 
enjoyed this process because I could see how a person would interact, when ,
and why they did certain things live in person. I even tried breaking the game
after this to ensure that all the bugs from the previeous verson were 
fixed and that my logic was not flawed.

# Credits 
I would like to credit numerous cites for inspiration in ux design.
Cites used for my iframe <a href="https://www.typing.com/">website I used to 
inspiration</a> I would also like to credit to stackoverflow community for any 
methods and code snippets used, it was a really awesome resource to roll 
up my sleeves and learn on the website.

# Media 

Any media you see inside this web application was created by yours truly
a.k.a me. Fonts were borrowed and inspired by 
<a href ="https://zeraxas.github.io/Word-Beater/">here.</a>
But I overcame many of them through the help of my mentor abhay barthwal.
My countdown timer uses digtal-7 webfont kit to give it a very nice digital
display from <a href ="https://www.dafont.com/digital-7.font">here.</a>

## Acknowledgements

I would like to acknowledge the use of bootstrap components. As well as 
w3schools.com for when I got stuck, I also searched stackoverflow.com countless
times for more information to solve problems with my application when I was stuck 
on the harder portions. I am thankful that my project is finally exactly as I  
had envsioned if not better.  Thank you for viewing this presentation of my HTML,
CSS,and Bootstrap, and javascript practical application to 
a real project I enjoyed making it and hope to present more to you in the future.
Until then that wraps up my skills as as a brand new front-end web developer.
